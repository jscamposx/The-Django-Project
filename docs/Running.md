<h1>Running The Django Project</h1>

First of all if you are going to <a href = "https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project">Contribute</a>, you should create your own <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo">Fork</a> before starting to clone.
```git
git clone (Your Fork Url) # Ex: https://github.com/zekaekop/The-Django-Project.git
```

When you have cloned it in your working directory, you should create a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html">Python Virtual Enviorment</a>
and install the requirements.txt located in the The-Django-Project folder.

```python
python -m venv C:\path\to\new\virtual\environment
```

And Activate the Virtual Enviorment by running <b>"venv\Scripts\activate"</b>.

```
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```

Once it is done you can run, and it will be avaliable on your browser at "http://127.0.0.1:8000".

```
python manage.py runserver
```
